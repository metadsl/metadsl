/**
 * OK the idea here is to be able to represent our types and functions in JSON.
 *
 * Why? Good question, well I think it makes the core system a lot smaller.
 * You can also more easily generate JSON then generate Python code.
 *
 * The idea would be to use this JSON to generate `metadsl` code.
 *
 * This type system is pretty much like System F, because types can take
 * parameters, except it doesn't allow functions to take functions as parameters,
 * only values. Why this restriction? Not sure exactly, I just came to this
 * setup when building from the top down. We actually build an untyped lambda
 * calculus *embedded* in this system, so we use that pass functions to other functions.
 *
 * It's a system for building DSLs, so the functions that you pass around are not first
 * class, they are just data structures that represent functions aka the simply typed
 * lambda calculus. It seems to work!
 *
 * Takes a look at the `metadsl_core` package next to this one, if you wanna see
 * what these things look like in Python land.
